    <p>Welcome to Transcraft MTD. This facility enables submissions to the
        <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/mtd">HMRC MTD</a> (Making Tax Digital) portal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assumption is you have a technical background and have already obtained the calculated numbers for the
        submission elsewhere. This site will only facilitate the final hurdle of interacting with the HMRC portal
        to perform the actual submission using their provided
        <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api">API</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to <a href="/admin/createUser">create a user</a> first, simply in order to store your own HMRC
        provided parameters, before you can make a submission.
        The parameters are personal to you and are allocated once you have registered with
        <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration">HMRC Developer Hub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your data is private to you and will not be shared with anyone else without your expressed consent.
        Every possible effort has been made to ensure storage of this data is secure and difficult to compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
        To log into the site, you will need to have set up the OTP (One Time Passcode) with an OTP generator app
        (an example is
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Google Authenticator</a>)
        using the QR code generated by the
        <a href="/admin/createUser">Create New User</a> page. <i>Please ensure you do this before creating the user,
            or you will not be able to log into the site subsequently under that user</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note: </b>This site will <i>not</i> store any HMRC credentials while you make your submissions.
        The session will automatically expire once you log off HMRC.
